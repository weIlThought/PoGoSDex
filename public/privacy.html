        Cookies

        We use cookies to store information for your convenience (“Settings”).
        We also may use third party advertisements on the Site. Some of these
        advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they
        advertise on the Site, which will also send these advertisers (such as
        Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP
        address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some
        cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for
        geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in
        New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites
        visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking
        sites).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4" data-i18n="privacy_cookies_disable">
        You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or
        third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences
        in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can greatly
        affect how you are able to interact with the Site as well as most other
        websites.
